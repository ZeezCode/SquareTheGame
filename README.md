# SquareTheGame
==================
My final project for my Comp Sci class, "Square - The Game": A game about circles  
  
This was built using the JGameGUI API made by Ethan Zeigler at: https://github.com/EthanZeigler/JGameGUI

Next update will contain blue enemy circles that take 10 hp from you upon collision, you have 100hp at the start of the round
There will be a health bar as well
There might also be a leaderboard system in place eventually
The project's due at the end of this week so expect frequent updates this week
