# SquareTheGame
==================
My final project for my Comp Sci class, "Square - The Game": A game about circles  
  
This was built using the JGameGUI API made by Ethan Zeigler at: https://github.com/EthanZeigler/JGameGUI

The next update will likely only include part/all of the leaderboard system and bug fixes, seeing as I'm handing in the "finished product" in about 10 hours
