# SquareTheGame
==================
My final project for my Comp Sci class, "Square - The Game": A game about circles  
  
This was built using the JGameGUI API made by Ethan Zeigler at: https://github.com/EthanZeigler/JGameGUI

The next update will probably include a punishment for having 0 health (game ending), a way to restart the game when it ends rather than simply restarting the program when you want to play again. The leaderboard system will likely come this weekend or later, I doubt I'll have time to finish it in time for the project's due date, but I already did more than I was supposed to so it doesn't matter much
